## Interpretation of Multivariate Machine Learning Models Based on Stochastic Processes

This repository provides a user interface for basic use cases of the Orthogonal Additive Kernel for Gaussian processes.
The backend of this software is a partially altered version of the code
at https://github.com/amzn/orthogonal-additive-gaussian-processes.
Supported file types are .mat. The file format is required to match the example cases, with a NxD array for the input
features and a Nx1 array for the output values.
